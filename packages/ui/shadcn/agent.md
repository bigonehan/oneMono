# Data Attribute Conventions

- Use the `data-anim` attribute to surface animation targets; limit values to `title`, `description`, `pane`, and `img`.
- Attach the marker to the most semantically relevant element so animation selectors remain stable.
- Components located under `components/ui` are excluded from this convention unless explicitly opted in.
