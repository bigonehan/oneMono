# Subagent Feedback (Independent Review)

- The landing now mirrors `.ai/content.md`, including a dedicated feature list grid instead of the previous tabbed layout.
- New shared components (`InformationalSection`, `FeatureListSection`, `CallToActionSection`) improve reuse and keep storytelling consistent.
- Suggest linking actual store URLs once available to replace placeholder anchors (`#download`, `#app`, `#trial`) for production readiness.
