# Gapyear Landing Review — 2025-10-30

## Smooth scroll loop keeps running after unmount
- **Location:** `app/web/gapyear/src/components/SmoothScroll.ts:24-41`
- **Impact:** High – Causes runaway `requestAnimationFrame` loops, elevated CPU usage, and broken restores when React remounts the component (e.g., under Strict Mode or route transitions).
- **Details:** The `raf` callback schedules a new animation frame on every tick but the effect cleanup only calls `lenis.destroy()`. The scheduled frame keeps firing after unmount, so the destroyed Lenis instance continues to receive `raf` calls. In dev Strict Mode the effect runs twice, leaving two rAF loops alive; this also leaks when navigating away from the page.
- **Recommendation:** Track the frame id returned by `requestAnimationFrame`, cancel it in the cleanup, and guard the callback so it stops once the component unmounts (and optionally remove the `scroll` listener or re-create a new Lenis instance only after cleanup completes).

## Duplicate `<main>` landmarks break semantics
- **Location:** `app/web/gapyear/app/layout.tsx:32-34` and `app/web/gapyear/app/page.tsx:10-34`
- **Impact:** Medium – Violates HTML5/ARIA landmark rules; screen reader users will find two `<main>` regions, which is invalid and makes navigation harder. Some automated accessibility scanners will flag this as an error.
- **Details:** The root layout wraps children in `<main>`, and the page component renders its own `<main>` around the hero. This produces nested main landmarks in the rendered HTML.
- **Recommendation:** Keep the landmark in only one place (either change the layout container to a `<div>` or have page components return fragments/sections instead of another `<main>`).

## Primary hero CTA is a dead button
- **Location:** `app/web/gapyear/app/page.tsx:21-23`
- **Impact:** Medium – The button labeled “알아보기” has no `onClick` handler or link target, so the main call-to-action on the landing page does nothing. This blocks the intended conversion funnel.
- **Details:** The element is rendered as a plain `<button>` outside any form and lacks navigation logic. Users click it expecting to scroll or navigate but nothing happens.
- **Recommendation:** Convert it to a Next.js `Link` (or anchor) that jumps to the relevant section, or wire an `onClick`/`lenis.scrollTo` handler so the button performs a meaningful action.
